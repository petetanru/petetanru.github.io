After an 8-year hiatus, I'm returning to this blog. The tech landscape has transformed dramatically since my last post in 2017, and it feels like the right time to resume documenting thoughts and experiences.

## What Changed?

When I last wrote here, machine learning was just beginning to enter mainstream consciousness. Today, we're in the midst of an AI revolution with large language models changing how we work, create, and think about technology.

AI now enables:
- **Natural language coding**: Writing code through conversation
- **Instant content creation**: From text to images to video
- **Automated reasoning**: Complex problem-solving at scale
- **Personal assistants**: AI agents handling tasks autonomously

## Why Return Now?

The pace of change in technology has never been faster. With AI assistants helping us code, new frameworks emerging monthly, and paradigm shifts happening regularly, there's more to discuss and document than ever before.

This blog will serve as a space to:
- Share insights on emerging technologies
- Document learning experiences
- Showcase AI-related projects

## What's Next?

I'm updating this blog's infrastructure (Jekyll, dependencies, and deployment pipeline) to modern standards. Future posts will cover technical deep-dives, project updates, and thoughts on where technology is heading.

Stay tuned for more updates!
