Last year (2015) marked my transition toward the IT industry and of all the IT-startup-management books I've read this past year, 
my absolute favorite is ["The Hard Thing About Hard Things"][hard-thing] by [Ben Horowitz][ben]. There is hardly any chapter that I did not find insightful, which says a lot 
for a management book! Let's get straight to some of the reasons why I like this book. 

####It is the antithesis of "become successful in 1 week" books
Ben makes it clear that entrepreneurship is not a road filled with roses. The book attempts to recount tough struggles Ben faced as an entrepreneur, to discuss them 
in a frank manner (20% of the book is actually about him freaking out at the time...), and to evaluate them in  Many tough issues are tough because
of their nature, and there is just no easy way around it. 

####It covers many (shit hits the fan) type of issue that MANY management books shy away from 
ie: hiring more experienced staffs, firing executives, managing politics in your company, the loneliness of CEOs, the diverse emotional perspectives of company events (such as being approached with an offer to buy), etc. 

####An example of this is: 
        
**"Do you demote or fire your executive who has worked very hard but just isn't world class"? 
And worse, what if it was your friend, in which the process may trigger the feeling of betrayal and embarrassment?** 

Ben discusses a set of things you would want to consider.

1. Get ready at the thought that the person may leave the company. 
2. Do not go into it with as an open discussion. Given the emotional intensity, being on a whim can ruin your relationship
with the person. It also removes the possibility of the person lobbying for the old job, which could become very awkward and 
demoralizing. 
3. “Admit that if you were a more experienced CEO, you might be able to develop him into the role, but two people who don’t know what they are doing is a recipe for failure.”
4. Acknowledge the contributions of the person and think through the alternative role you want to offer, with the that person's career development in mind. 


**If there is one startup book that I would recommend you to read, this is the one.**
