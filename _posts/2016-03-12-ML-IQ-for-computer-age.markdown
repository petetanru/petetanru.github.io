Just as modern research is taking a new shape, so are the importance of different intellectual skills.  

**Library and online searches** -- Modern day research and education is just a few buttons away via online searches. A modern witty or factually rigorous person is not someone who goes to the library often, but rather those who bother to look up information via their mobile phone. Want to know how many pianos are made in the US per year? Search it online! Want to build a rocket in your backyard? Search it online! Only university libraries have books that never made it to the online world (though arguably the most important ones are aleady online in pdf form). 

**Storage and memorization** -- As human society abstract and grapple bigger and bigger amount of information, our minds are no longer the best place to store everything. Storage space and memory leak really trouble us. The challenge of a modern person is rather memory management. How do we make space for and retain the most important piece of information. And before that, how do we decide what is important? This is why even when a university lecture is recorded, students will still want the professor's slide; they believe those slides contain the essence, the most important stuff, in the lecture. 
Having said all that, I still think knowing a language with easily over 30k words and complex rules like English is a great thing. Our views and ideas are also defined by the concepts and langauge we have at our disposal. 

*side-note: I've always found jeopardy a really really pointless game. It tests you on an extremely useless aspect with very little tangent value--your knowledge of random facts.*

**Pattern Recognition/Application** -- The Economists has a really great quote on AI regarding this, "The pattern-recognising abilities of deep-learning algorithms are impressive, but computers still lack many of the mental tools that humans take for granted. A big one is “transfer learning”, which is what AI researchers call reasoning by analogy. This is the ability to take lessons learned in one domain and apply them to another. And machines like AlphaGo have no goals, and no more awareness of their own existence than does a word processor or a piece of accounting software." I don't think the days of widely accessible machine learning tools is far off, and just as excel and data science is valued today, the ability to use advanced analytical tools will be even more pronounced in the future. 

So what does this all mean? It means a modern 'smart' person is someone who is eager to search online questions rather than postpone, someone who strategize learning (ie: Zuckerberg made a forum for Harvard students to share notes and interpretations of text because he wasn't studying at all), and someone who really knows how to use their tools.  

I've omitted several issues here that I have not fully worked out how it fits into the above discussion, such as reasoning skills.
