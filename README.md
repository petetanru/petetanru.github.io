Pete's Blog
===========

My beta-stage personal blog. The link to it is here: [Pete's blog][]

Special credit to my friend Neizod for creating the site's Jekyll theme, "Polar". The following is the original readme text. 


Polar Theme
===========

Polar is a white-clean Jekyll theme, hence name *Polar* as in [polar bear][]. This theme is implemented especially for GitHub Pages. Its offer you:

- __Content First__ Primary focus of this theme is to catch your audiences with the beautiful rendered content. Here are some of its strength:
  - __Math & Sci__ Need to show some math equations? Say goodbye to plain text math when you can write complex LaTeX math equation and still get pretty displayed output thank to [MathJax][].
  - __Data Emphasis__ Need to show a data table with lots of columns? This theme will not squeeze them down to the size that is hard to read. Just say the content is `oversized` and everything will looks nice.
  - __SEO Friendly__ Share a post on social network? You can be sure that no one will look over it because of bad preview.
- __Minimal UI__ You don't get more than you really need.
  - __Responsive Design__ Theme will be renderd to fit on the screen, no matter how large or small.
  - __Small Footprint__ No huge CSS or JS framework to slowdown loading time, thanks to CSS3 Flexbox (and sorry IE10 users).
- __Easy to Customize__ You don't need to be an expert in CSS or understand Jekyll engine to customize this theme.
  - __Color__ Don't like default color and have no idea on how to mix and match? No problem since you can supply as minimal as 2 main colors and let this theme figure out the rest.
  - __Font__ Thaks [Google Fonts][] for the CDN. Now go there and grap your favorite one to use here!

This theme would not be shaped like this without the grand inspirations from:

- [Skeleton][] for how to make use of fonts and spaces.
- [Tufte CSS][] for what is a beautiful rendered content.
- [Jekyll Now][] for guide on how to place surrounding UI.
- [Amplify][] for how fast a web should be!

Kudos!


Development Branches Explained
------------------------------

Since my intention is to keep this project as small as possible, only 2 branches should be necessary.

- __Master__ This branch contain only theme code. You can clone it and start fill in your blog content from there. The README file is also omitted from this branch since I beleive everyone should write this file as greating page for your GitHub repository.
- __GH-Pages__ This branch contain sample content and document. It also served as demo web on `https://neizod.github.io/polar`.
