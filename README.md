Special credit to my friend Neizod for creating the site's Jekyll theme, "Polar". 

Polar Theme
===========

Polar is a white-clean design theme, hence name *Polar* as in [polar bear][].
This theme is implemented for Jekyll and GitHub Pages. It's mainly inspire by:

- [Skeleton][] for how to make use of fonts and spaces.
- [Jekyll Now][] for guilds on how to place something somewhere.
- [Amplify][] for how fast it can be!
