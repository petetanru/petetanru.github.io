[Go to the calculator!]

I recently revamped my friend Uri's project, adopting much of the style from a [html/css tutorial site] . Exerpt from the 'about' page: 

## days
Calculates how many days old you are. 

My friend asked me how many days old I was and I realised I'd never thought about it that way, it seemed like a really interesting way to think about time. Somehow more manageable than "years old," because a year is so big but I have more of a sense of what a day feels like.

I think it would be cool if we celebrated our big day milestones. Like people throwing parties for their 10,000th day.

> What are days for? <br />
Days are where we live.... <br />
Where can we live but days? <br />
