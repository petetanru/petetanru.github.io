title: About Me
---

My name is Pete, Peeradej Tanruangporn, and I consider myself a social scientist turned tech-enthusiast. I currently work as a 
business analyst with MOL Global, an epayment company based largely in Southeast Asia. In my free time, I read and think a lot about new business ideas. Recently, I have been a little obsessed about implementing my own machine learning pet project.. 

Feel free to drop me comments and feedbacks!
