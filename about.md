As of late 2016, I have left my job to pursue the field of Artificial Intelligence full-time. Previously, I worked for an e-payment company that provides services for developing countries called MOL Global. My roles included strategy and business analysis, and occasionally project management.


In my previous life I did social science and policy research. I have an Mphil in Politics from Cambridge U., UK, and a BA in Economics and International Development from Trent U., Canada. I have worked for academia, international organizations, and a think tank.
