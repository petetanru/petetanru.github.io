My name is Pete, Peeradej Tanruangporn, and I am a social scientist turned tech-entrepreneur. In this site, I share 
with you things that awe and excite me! Feel free to drop me a word if you have any thoughts about my posts!



I use Jekyll to build this site. You can check it out here - 
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %}
