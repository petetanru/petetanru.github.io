My name is Pete, Peeradej Tanruangporn, and I am a social scientist turned tech-enthusiast. I currently work as a 
business analyst with MOL, a payment company for digital contents based mostly in Southeast Asia. In this site, I share 
with you things that awe and excite me! Feel free to drop me a word if you have any thoughts about my posts!



I use Jekyll to build this site. You can check it out here - 
{% include icon-github.html username="jekyll" %}
