My name is Pete, Peeradej Tanruangporn, and I am a social scientist turned tech-enthusiast. I currently work as a 
business analyst with MOL Global, an epayment company based largely in Southeast Asia. 

Feel free to drop me comments and feedbacks!



I use Jekyll to build this site. You can check it out here -
